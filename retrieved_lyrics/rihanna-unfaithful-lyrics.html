[Verse 1]Story of my life, searching for the rightBut it keeps avoiding meSorrow in my soul 'cause it seems that wrongReally loves my companyHe's more than a man and this is more than loveThe reason that the sky is blueThe clouds are rolling in because I'm gone againAnd to him, I just can't be true[Pre-Chorus]And I know that he knows I'm unfaithfulAnd it kills him insideTo know that I am happy with some other guyI can see him dying[Chorus]I don't wanna do this anymoreI don't wanna be the reason whyEvery time I walk out the doorI see him die a little more insideI don't wanna hurt him anymoreI don't wanna take away his lifeI don't wanna be a murderer[Verse 2]I feel it in the air as I'm doin' my hairPreparing for another dateA kiss upon my cheek as he reluctantlyAsks if I'm gonna be out lateI say I won't be long, just hanging with the girlsA lie I didn't have to tellBecause we both know where I'm about to goAnd we know it very well [Pre-Chorus]'Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithfulAnd it kills him insideTo know that I am happy with some other guyI can see him dying[Chorus]I don't wanna do this anymoreI don't wanna be the reason whyEvery time I walk out the doorI see him die a little more insideI don't wanna hurt him anymoreI don't wanna take away his lifeI don't wanna be a murderer[Bridge]Our love, his trustI might as well take a gun and put it to his headGet it over withI don't wanna do this anymoreWoah, anymore[Chorus]And I don't wanna do this anymoreI don't wanna be the reason whyAnd every time I walk out the doorI see him die a little more insideAnd I don't wanna hurt him anymoreI don't wanna take away his lifeI don't wanna be a murderer [Outro]A murderer, no, no, noYeah, yeah
